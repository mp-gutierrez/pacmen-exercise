<h2>Title of the project</h2>
    Bouncing PacMen Factory
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
    This project is a generator of same-sized PacMen that can be set up to move at random speeds and directions.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. With the files in place, a simple drag-n-drop of the index.html file into a chromium-based browser will load the game.
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    The index.html has two buttons: "Add PacMan" and "Start Game".
    "AddPacMan" adds a PacMan; the number is unlimited.
    "Start game" makes the PacMen move around the browser window. If clicked more than once, the velocity of each generated PacMan increases.
    Refreshing the page restarts the game.
