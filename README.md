Title of the project
    Bouncing PacMen Factory

Description
    A generator of same-sized PacMen that moves them at random speeds and directions. 


Installation
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. With the files in place, a simple drag-n-drop of the index.html file into a chromium-based browser will load the game.

Usage
    The index.html has two buttons: "Add PacMan" and "Start Game".
    "AddPacMan" adds a PacMan; the number is unlimited.
    "Start game" makes the PacMen move around the browser window. If clicked more than once, the velocity of each generated PacMan increases.
    Refreshing the page restarts the game.

Improvements to come
    Adding noise to the chomps of each PacMan
    Make each PacMan bite continously
